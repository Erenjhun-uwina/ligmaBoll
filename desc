LIGMABOL is a unique platformer where you play as a living energy sphere (Bol). The challenge? Survive by conserving movement and collecting essence. Every action counts—moving too much drains your energy, while smart choices keep you alive longer. Players can even use foes to their advantage, bouncing off them to preserve momentum. It’s a survival-platformer that rewards creativity, patience, and strategy.
